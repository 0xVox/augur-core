this works for all but scalar stuff
x events have outcomes 1 2 3 etc.
add a dimension and you get columns
 so let's say the 2nd dimension has 1 2 3 4 outcomes

so outcome 1 and outcome 1 have 1
2 and 1 are 2
3 and 1 are 3

if you have outcome 1 and outcome 2 it's numOutcomesinX*1 + 1
outcome 2 and outcome 2 is numOutcomesinX*1 + 2
outcome 1 and outcome 3 is numOutcomesinX*2 + 1

add the third dimension say
outcome 1 and outcome
