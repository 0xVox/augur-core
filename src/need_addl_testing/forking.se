#Essentially, we could allow anyone to pay some amount significantly greater than the bond amount to force a branching event, splitting rep into two classes.  In one class the reported outcome for whatever event was the cause of dispute is said to be right, and rep would be redistributed accordingly.  In the other class/branch, the event would be readjudicated and remove the outcome on the pre fork branch and rep would be redistributed as normal, except people who said the original outcome in the original fork lose rep.  
# Note: Whichever outcome was truly the correct one would determine which branch had rep that actually held value.  This would be akin to a Bitcoin hard fork scenario.  The winning fork, of course, would be the one with the most voluminous markets.  Market makers should then be able to move their market to whichever fork they want, if they fail to act, it'd go to the most voluminous fork by default after a couple weeks.

# what if multiple things need to be forked?
# any markets up for readjudication which need to be forked due to a "wrong" outcome are readjudicated on whichever network wins the fork, bond is transferred to wherever it moves to and no rbcr is done for that event until it's decided which fork it belongs on
	# save outcome that's being contested [so w/e the og network decided
# 1% of rep or highest bidder
# In short: If a market is unethical, that fact is all that matters when it comes to bonds, appeals, and payouts.The outcome only matters for reputation adjustment (since this ignores ethicallity) and nothing else
# fork remove ethicality option if was forked over ethicality, other ethicality choice is the ethicality

# and moving all the markets w/ a fork?
# so in last 24 hours during period where a round 2 was pushed back to, can be made to fork instead of just round 2, so round 2 bond poster gets bond back? or stick w/ round 2 on the pre fork network?

To talk about the smaller fork bond posted:
The fork bond is paid. Saved along with it is the current consensus that is being contested.
The bonds exist in both forks.
The market either waits for a fork or goes to back to re-adjudication, possibly more than once.
The market gets a consensus that no one appeals on the 24 hour period eventually, and the consensus is made final.
This final consensus is compared with the consensus the fork was initially done over.
a) If the final truth/consensus  is different than the one that was contested, then we know for sure the bond poster was justified in posting the fork bond, and it is handled at this point in time, paying the poster back, and collecting from the reporters that committed to the consensus the bond poster correctly identified as liars.
b) If the final truth/consensus is the same as the one that was contested, then we know for sure the bond poster contested a consensus that we know for sure was truth, and the fork bond posted was malicious. The fork bond is paid to the reporters for their additional labor.


# what to do if market forked - readj. - forked again what do w/ orig readj. rep?  never happened b/c it wasn't the main fork market
def fork(event):
	if(!EVENTS.getRoundTwo(event)):
		return(-1)
	# branch 1
		# lose bond of 5k rep
		# results same as roundtwobond
	# branch 2
		# take 20% of rep away from liars in fork, don't distribute to truthtellers until a new truthful outcome is resolved / reported
		# results opposite as roundtwobond
		#a) return the bond
		#b) reward the bonded challenger with whatever rep would normally be taken from the liars up to 2x the bond, then beyond that the people who originally reported whatever the actual truth was would get the rest.
		#Additionally, the rewards for all other answerers are made more extreme: rep redistribution constant used for smoothing is .40 instead of .2
		
# push forward for early resolution can't happen during fork
