### To do:
	# MVP
		# trading fees for markets
		# voting period fixes / when can / can't vote / when things up for voting
		# redeem (multiple tx stuff from consensus)
		# update api
		# accuracy of exp needs to be within .1%
	# Implement Version 0.3
	# implement .5 outcome pricing?
	# ditto for mcopy and local arrays
	# Vitalik bond idea for event creation

### Version 0.5 (More fun features - May):
	# need to add audits
	# special cfds + public good funding + poss. futarchy
	# decentralized exchange (etherex and chow) -- chow exchange needs a way to prevent two people from claiming an order, sending bitcoin, then being screwed unless altruism (suggest a claim tx w/ possible small ether bond and during that time no one else can claim the exchange tx - but if you wait too long you lose the bond + it becomes open again, something like that)
	# make code updatable + work with etherex
	# https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/01/28/p-epsilon-attack/
	# stablecoin
	# could have multiple people add liquidity to the market :o

### Version 0.4 (Awesome fun stuff - April):
	# make sure this follows paul's whitepaper well	
	# reward whoever does redeem and close market according to gas cost
	# zeroing of array values
	# hash first frontrunning prevention mechanism
	# salt hash vote mechanism
	# high fees to check event outcome - doesn't solve freeloader problem :/

### Version 0.3 (The Voting Upgrade - March):
	# randomized voter selection? - first x events expiring vote on in one ballot - random selection, then another ballot
	# fast voting cycle first few days to get the 60% problem away from a branch, e.g. what if not enough people vote
	# 60% of votes -- need to get the cycle length parameters right
	# rapid rbcr anytime to vote i'm alive if <60% of people vote after a few cycles or something
	# max number of owners in a branch of rep.ä¸ª
	# go over stuff in close and redeem txs
