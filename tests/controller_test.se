# Tests are in controller_tests.py file which tests the controller by calling
# various controller.se and controller_test.se functions --- current testing
# contract examples also available in the tests folder.

# self.controller = 0x0 [this is the controller contract's address, you
# have a few ways in getting it here, one is to get the address of the
# controller contract once you've uploaded it in the pyethereum tester,
# another is to just upload the contract here using create]
