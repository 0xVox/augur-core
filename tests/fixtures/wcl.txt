Filling a bid [so selling]:
    maker escrowed shares in all outcomes except this one, taker does not have shares in this outcome /// maker is closing a short position, taker is going short:
        - The maker has 10 shares escrowed in every outcome except the one bidding on and is wanting to buy them at .60 for a total of 6 ETH. Taker fills the bid at .60 for 10 shares and should pay a cost of .40 for 10 shares for a total of 4 ETH [since they're shorting]. The taker doesn't have shares so a complete set needs to be issued by combining the 4 ETH and the 6 ETH [maker gets shares in the outcome they're missing, which is sold for 10 eth, and they then get to keep 4 ETH] to make 10 ETH. 10 shares of every outcome except the one being sold go to the taker, the 10 being sold go to the maker. The maker should now have their 10 complete sets sold [since they're essentially closing a short] and make (max - price)*numShares or 4 ETH.
    maker escrowed cash, taker does not have shares in this outcome /// maker is going long, taker is going short:
        - The maker is placing a bid for 10 shares at 0.60 each, costing them 6 ETH in escrow with the market. The taker fills the bid at .60 for 10 shares and has to pay 4 ETH total to the market. They get paid 6 ETH from the maker, need to pay 4 more ETH to the market + that 6 ETH, and complete sets are issued.  Then the maker gets 10 of the outcome and 10 of every other outcome go to the taker.  
    maker escrowed shares in all outcomes except this one, taker has shares in this outcome /// maker is closing a short position, taker is closing a long position:
        - The maker is placing a bid for 10 shares at .60 each and has shares escrowed in every outcome except the one bidding on. Taker fills the bid at .60 for 10 shares and has 10 shares. These 10 shares are sent to the maker. The maker's complete sets are sold and 6 ETH are sent to the taker.  The maker ends up with 4 ETH proceeds after closing their short.

Filling an ask [so buying]:
    maker escrowed shares in this outcome, taker does not have shares in all outcomes except this one /// maker is closing a long position, taker is going long:
        - The maker had 10 shares escrowed by placing an ask for 10 shares @ .60 each. Taker fills an ask at 0.60 for 10 shares, they should spend 6 ETH [price - min per share] on this trade and end up with 10 more shares of the outcome. The maker should receive 6 ETH and not have access to those 10 shares anymore [like they shouldn't be able to cancel their order and get the 10 shares back, they've gone from their account -> market -> taker]. The market should no longer have those 10 shares in escrow.
    maker escrowed cash, taker does not have shares in all outcomes except this one /// maker is going short, taker is going long:
        - The maker wants to sell 10 shares and places an ask for 10 shares @ .60 each, the maker doesn't own shares so 4 ETH [(max - price)*numShares] is escrowed. Taker fills an ask at 0.60 [price - min per share] for 10 shares, they should spend 6 ETH on this trade and end up with 10 more shares of the outcome. The maker should receive 10 shares in each outcome except the one they sold. The market should no longer have those 4 ETH shares in escrow since they were used with the 6 ETH to issue a complete set and split it up between the maker and taker. This is effectively short selling by the maker.
    maker escrowed shares in this outcome, taker has shares in all outcomes except this one /// maker is closing a long position, taker is short the outcome and closing:
        - The maker had 10 shares escrowed by placing an ask for 10 shares @ .60 each. Taker fills an ask at 0.60 [price - min per share] for 10 shares, they should receive (max - .60)*numShares or 4 ETH on this trade and end up with 10 less shares of every outcome except for no change in the outcome they're buying, the reason is buying this outcome completes a complete set and that is then sold, which essentially closes out a short position. The maker should receive 6 ETH and not have access to those 10 shares anymore [like they shouldn't be able to cancel their order and get the 10 shares back, they've gone from their account -> market -> taker -> complete set sold]. The market should no longer have those 10 shares in escrow.
    maker escrowed cash, taker has shares in all outcomes except this one /// maker is going short, taker is short the outcome and closing:
        - The maker wants to sell 10 shares and places an ask for 10 shares @ .60 each, the maker doesn't own shares so 4 ETH [(max - price)*numShares] is escrowed. Taker fills an ask at 0.60 [price - min per share] for 10 shares, they should receive 4 ETH on this trade (max - .60)*numShares and end up with 10 less shares of every outcome except for no change in the outcome they're buying, the reason is buying this outcome completes a complete set and that is then sold, which essentially closes out a short position. The maker should receive 10 shares in each outcome except the one they sold. This is effectively short selling by the maker and closing out a short by the taker. Note, this one is a bit more complex, so more explaination of what is happening under the hood: What happens here is the taker gets the final outcome needed to close their short, which is then sold [the complete sets] and yields 10 ETH. The maker has escrowed 4 ETH, that's combined with 6 ETH from the taker's complete set money [since they're buying .60 * 10 it adds up to 6 ETH] to then issue 10 shares in each outcome to the maker who is shorting, except for the one outcome they're shorting. 4 ETH is left over which is the taker's payment for closing out their short position.  Intuitively this makes sense, if you are short outcome x and decide to close your short by buying outcome x back at .60, then your proceeds are .40 per share, or 4 ETH. And as the maker, if you are shorting outcome x at .60, your WCL is .40 per share or 4 ETH as you'd expect.
