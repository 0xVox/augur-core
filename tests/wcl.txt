Note, these test cases are designed such that you can write while loops and randomly vary the # of shares and the price once you've written the first one of each [as long as the price you specify is within the range] and the math'll add up.
Filling a bid [so selling]:
    maker escrowed shares in all outcomes except this one, taker does not have shares in this outcome /// maker is closing a short position, taker is going short:
        - The maker has n shares escrowed in every outcome except the one bidding on and is wanting to buy them at price x for a total of (x - min)*n ETH. Taker fills the bid and should pay a cost of (max - x)*n ETH [since they're shorting]. The taker doesn't have shares so complete sets need to be issued by combining the (x - min)*n from the maker + (max - x)*n from the taker [which makes range] ETH. The maker gets shares in the outcome they're missing, which completes their sets which are sold for range eth, and they then get to keep (max - x)*n ETH, the other part of the range (x-min)*n is used to issue the taker's complete set. N shares of every outcome except the one being sold go to the taker, the n being sold go to the maker.
    maker escrowed cash, taker does not have shares in this outcome /// maker is going long, taker is going short:
        - The maker is placing a bid for n shares at x each, costing them (x - min)*n ETH in escrow with the market. The taker fills the bid and has to pay (max - x)*n ETH total to the market. They get paid (x-min)*n ETH from the maker and need to pay (max - x)*n more ETH to the market + that (x-min)*n from the maker, and complete sets are issued.  Then the maker gets n of the outcome and n of every other outcome go to the taker.  
    maker escrowed shares in all outcomes except this one, taker has shares in this outcome /// maker is closing a short position, taker is closing a long position:
        - The maker is placing a bid for n shares at x each and has shares escrowed in every outcome except the one bidding on. Taker fills the bid at x for n shares and has n shares. These n shares are sent to the maker. The maker's now formed complete sets are then sold and (x - min)*n ETH are sent to the taker. The maker ends up with (max - x)*n ETH proceeds after closing their short.
    maker escrowed cash, taker has shares in this outcome /// maker is going long, taker is closing a long position:
        - The maker is placing a bid for n shares at x each, costing them (x - min)*n ETH in escrow with the market. Taker fills the bid at x for n shares and already has n shares. These n shares are sent to the maker. The maker's (x - min)*n ETH are then sent to the taker.

Filling an ask [so buying]:
    maker escrowed shares in this outcome, taker does not have shares in all outcomes except this one /// maker is closing a long position, taker is going long:
        - The maker had n shares escrowed by placing an ask for n shares @ x each. Taker fills an ask at x for n shares, they should spend (price - min)*n ETH on this trade and end up with n more shares of the outcome. The maker should receive (price - min)*n ETH and not have access to those n shares anymore [like they shouldn't be able to cancel their order and get the 10 shares back, they've gone from their account -> market -> taker]. The market should no longer have those n shares in escrow.
    maker escrowed cash, taker does not have shares in all outcomes except this one /// maker is going short, taker is going long:
        - The maker wants to sell n shares and places an ask for n shares @ x each, the maker doesn't own shares so (max - x)*n ETH is escrowed. Taker fills an ask at x for n shares, they should spend (x - min)*n ETH on this trade and end up with n more shares of the outcome. The maker should receive n shares in each outcome except the one they sold. The market should no longer have the maker's (max - x)*n ETH in escrow since they were used with the taker's (x - min)*n ETH to issue a complete set and split it up between the maker and taker. This is effectively short selling by the maker.
    maker escrowed shares in this outcome, taker has shares in all outcomes except this one /// maker is closing a long position, taker is short the outcome and closing:
        - The maker had n shares escrowed by placing an ask for n shares @ x each. Taker fills an ask at x for n shares, they should receive (max - x)*n ETH on this trade and end up with n less shares of every outcome except for no change in the outcome they're buying, the reason is buying this outcome completes a complete set and that is then sold, which essentially closes out a short position. The maker should receive (price - min)*n ETH and not have access to those n shares anymore [like they shouldn't be able to cancel their order and get the n shares back, they've gone from their account -> market -> taker -> complete set sold]. The market should no longer have those n shares in escrow either.
    maker escrowed cash, taker has shares in all outcomes except this one /// maker is going short, taker is short the outcome and closing:
        - The maker wants to sell n shares and places an ask for n shares @ x each, the maker doesn't own shares so (max - x)*n ETH is escrowed. Taker fills an ask at x for n shares, they should receive (max - x)*n ETH on this trade and end up with n less shares of every outcome except for no change in the outcome they're buying, the reason is buying this outcome completes a complete set and that is then sold, which essentially closes out a short position. The maker should receive n shares in each outcome except the one they sold. This is effectively short selling by the maker and closing out a short by the taker. Note, this one is a bit more complex, so more explanation of what is happening under the hood: What happens here is the taker gets the final outcome needed to close their short, which is then sold [the complete sets] and yields range*n ETH. The maker has escrowed (max - x)*n ETH, that's combined with (price - min)*n ETH from the taker's complete set money to then issue n shares in each outcome to the maker who is shorting, except for the one outcome they're shorting. (max - x)*n ETH is left over which is the taker's payment for closing out their short position. Intuitively this makes sense, if you are short outcome x and decide to close your short by buying outcome x back at price x, then your proceeds are (max - x) per share, or (max - x)*n ETH. And as the maker, if you are shorting outcome x at price x, your WCL is (max - x) per share or (max - x)*n ETH as you'd expect.
